            /* 
                according to W3C, every element has an implied attribute Block Formatting Context(BFC),
                by default, it's closed

                when BFC is opened, 
                    1. this father element's vertical margin won't ovelap the child element
                      which means if child element's margin increases, father element won't be influenced
                    2. this element won't be covered by other floating elements
                    3. this element can contain floating child element


                How to open BFC:
                    1. set float  
                        -  height OK but width depends on the child element (not by default 100%) 
                            and the elements below in the file stream will move up
                    2. set absolute positioning:  position: absolute; (relative by default)
                        - make element get rid of file stream, same effects as 1

                    3. set as inline-block
                        - can solve the pb, but will lead width lose too
                    
                    4. set overflow as invisible

                    the most recommended way is to set overflow as auto or hidden

                Note:  IE6 and older version cannot support BFC
                        but IE6 has another implied attribute "hasLayout"
                        it's similar to BFC, we can open it to solve the pb
                        the lost recommended way is to set zoom as 1 (for IE6 and IE7)

                        zoom: 1;  

                        zoom means watch bigger, zoom: 1 means no zooming


                        it's recommended to write both lines to solve the pb

            /* height doesn't collapse, but width depends on content, 
                and the element after box1 goes up since box1 is out of file stream */
            /* float: left */

            /* position: absolute; */
            
            /* display: inline-block; */

            /* overflow: scroll; */
            /* overflow: hidden; */
            overflow: auto;
            zoom: 1;

        .box2 {
            width: 100px;
            height: 200px;
            background-color: blue;
            /* 
                when set float for child element, 
                father element height will collapse because child element get rid of file stream
                and all elements under father element will go up, which makes the layout unclear

                we can write a height for the father element, 
                however father element height won't be able to change automatically according to child element
